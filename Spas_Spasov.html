				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
				<br>
				industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
				<br>
				ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
				<br>
				and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
				<br>
				only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
				<br>
				remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
				<br>
				the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
				<br>
				more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
				<br>
				including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
				<br>
				<br>

				Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It 
				<br>
				has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
				<br>
				over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
				<br>
				Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more 
				<br>
				obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
				<br>
				going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the 
				<br>
				undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 
				<br>
				1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good 
				<br>
				and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
				<br>
				theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of 
				<br>
				Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in 
				<br>
				section 1.10.32.
				<br>
				<br>
				The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is 
				<br>
				reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 
				<br>
				from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced 
				<br>
				in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 
				<br>
				1914 translation by H. Rackham.
				<br>
				<br>
				<li><font size="5">Why do we use it?</font></li>
				<br>
				It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
				<br>
				readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
				<br>
				Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
				<br>
				as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
				<br>
				readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page 
				<br>
				editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search 
				<br>
				for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
				<br>
				Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
				<br>
				sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
				<br>
				<br>
				<li><font size="5">Where can I get some?</font></li>
				<br>
				There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but 
				<br>
				the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, 
				<br>
				or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you 
				<br>
				are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there 
				<br>
				isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem 
				<br>
				Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as 
				<br>
				necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a 
				<br>
				dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model 
				<br>
				sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. 
				<br>
				The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, 
				<br>
				injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
